| **Will Costumers leave soon?**    | Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers figured out it’s cheaper to save the existing customers rather than to attract new ones. This project was used to create a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will leave the bank soon based on the data of clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank. The project consisted of creating a DecissionTreeClassifier and a RandomForestClassifier model from the data; tuning each of the models' hyperparameters to obtain the highest F1 score, accuracy score, and AUC value from the ROC curve; The best model with the highest F1, accuracy, and AUC values was picked for the findings of task research. The threshold for the F1 score was a score of at least 0.59. | pandas, numpy, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, sklearn.model_selection, matplotlib.pyplot, OrdinalEncoder, StandardScaler, sklearn.metrics (f1_score, roc_curve, accuracy_score, roc_auc_score), sklearn.utils.shuffle, RandomizedSearchCV, GridSearchCV, linear_model | [Link](https://github.com/jmorenoflores/practicum_projects/tree/main/machine_learning/predicting_if_customers_will_leave_bank_services_project)|
| **Machine Learning Model to Pick the Right Mobile Plan**    | Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. The purpose of this project was to develop a machine learning model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend their customers one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. In this project, we analyzed the behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans. For this classification task, we developed a model that will pick the right plan and picked the model with the highest possible accuracy score. Megaline specified that the threshold for accuracy was 0.75. | pandas, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, sklearn.metrics (accuracy_score), sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split)| [Link](https://github.com/jmorenoflores/practicum_projects/tree/main/machine_learning/selecting_right_plan_project)|

| **Analyzing Borrowers’ Risk of Loan Defaulting**    | The loan division of a bank had provided data of their customers to find out if a customer's marital status and number of children have an inpact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. The purpose of this report was to analyze the relationship between default rate on loans and marital status and/or the number of children. This report was used to analyze if there is a increasing default rate on a loan as the number of children increase; as well as if being a widow, widower, divorced, or unmaried has a higher default rate compared to individuals who are married or in a civil partnership.| pandas, numpy, math, matplotlib.pyplot | [Link](https://github.com/jmorenoflores/practicum_projects/tree/main/exploratory_statistical_analysis/risk_of_loan_default_project)|
| **Which plan brings in more revenue?**    |  Megaline is a company that offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. The purpose of this project is to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. The data on 500 Megaline clients contains information about: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. This project was conducted to analyze the clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.| pandas, datetime, relativedelta, numpy, math, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy.stats |[Link](https://github.com/jmorenoflores/practicum_projects/tree/main/exploratory_statistical_analysis/selecting_plan_with_more_revenue_project)|
