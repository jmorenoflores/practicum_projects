| **ML to Automatically Detect Negative Reviews.**    | The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. The purpose of this project was to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. For our exploratory data analysis and training/validation/testing components of the project, we used a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews. The goal of this project was to reach an F1 score of at least 0.85. | numpy, pandas, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, tqdm, re, sklearn.metrics, DummyClassifier, nltk, TfidfVectorizer, LogisticRegression, nltk.corpus.stopwords, nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize, nltk.stem.WordNetLemmatizer, spacy, LGBMClassifier, GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, torch, transformers.BERT |[Link](https://github.com/jmorenoflores/practicum_projects/tree/main/machine_learning/detecting_negative_reviews_project)|
