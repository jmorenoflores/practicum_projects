| **Analyzing borrowers’ risk of loan defaulting**    | The loan division of a bank had provided data of their customers to find out if a customer's marital status and number of children have an inpact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. The purpose of this report is to analyze the relationship between default rate on loans and marital status and/or the number of children. This report was used to analyze if there is a increasing default rate on a loan as the number of children increase; as well as if being a widow, widower, divorced, or unmaried has a higher default rate compared to individuals who are married or in a civil partnership. | $1600 |   jsjsjs|
