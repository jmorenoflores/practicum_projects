# Project: **Will the game succeed?**

## Description and Purpose of Project:

The project **Will the game succeed?** used data from the online store *Ice*, which sells video games all over the world. The data had information about the user and expert reviews, genres, platforms, sales, and rating of videogames sold in 2016. The purpose of this project was to identify patterns that determined whether a video game was going to succeed in 2017, and also allow us to spot potential big winners to plan advertising campaigns.

For the analysis component of this project we looked at the number of games were that released in different years and also checked if the number of released games, for, every period was significant for our analysis. Similarly, we looked at patterns of how sales varied from platform to platform, and chose the platforms with the greatest total sales. From the list of platforms with greatest sales, we visualized distributions of sales based on data for each year. With the use of number of sales from each platform, we determined the platforms that used to be popular, but now have zero sales to answer the following business question:

*How long does it generally take for new platforms to appear and old ones to fade?.*

Consequently, we determined the period we should take data for to build a prognosis for 2017. In other words, we decided to work only with the data that we had decided is relevant and disregarded the data for previous years. With the use of relevant data, we analyzed the platforms that were leading in sales; the platforms that were growing or shrinking; and selected several potentially profitable platforms. From the list of chosen platforms, we studied how user and professional reviews affected sales for this popular platform and answer the following business questions:

1. *What can we say about the most profitable genres?*
2. *Can we generalize about genres with high and low sales?*

## Business value:
